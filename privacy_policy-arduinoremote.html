This means that if you are on an unsecured or public network, it may be possible for others on the same network to intercept this data. We recommend using this application only on a trusted, private, and secure network.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

  <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
